# INTRODUCTION

In the contemporary landscape of data-driven decision-making, accurate forecasting is paramount for effective business operations, particularly in sales and inventory management. The ability to predict future trends with precision facilitates optimized resource allocation, improved budget planning, and enhanced strategic initiatives. This report focuses on the application of ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average) models to forecast weekly sales data, leveraging advanced statistical techniques to unearth patterns and predict future movements accurately.

The ARIMA model is widely recognized for its flexibility and efficacy in handling various types of time series data. By incorporating lags of the differenced series in autoregressive (AR) and moving average (MA) components, ARIMA models adeptly capture the temporal dependencies and random fluctuations in time series data. This report systematically explores different configurations of the ARIMA model to determine the most suitable model based on the dataset characteristics.

# METHODOLOGY 

The analysis began with a preliminary examination of the data to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and potential transformations required to stabilize the variance and mean. Subsequent steps involved:

- **Model Identification**: Using plots of the data and autocorrelation function (ACF)/partial autocorrelation function (PACF) analysis to identify potential ARIMA models.

- **Parameter Estimation**: Fitting various ARIMA models to the data and refining them based on their coefficient significance and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), and error metrics.

- **Diagnostic Checks**: Validating the adequacy of the model fit by examining the residuals for any autocorrelation and ensuring no patterns were missed.

- **Forecasting**: Utilizing the selected ARIMA model to forecast future sales and evaluating its predictive accuracy through established error metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

### Summary Statistics

The dataset consists of weekly sales data across multiple stores and departments over a period. Below are the key summary statistics for each variable:

- **Store**: 
  - Range: 1 to 45
  - Median: 22
  - Mean: 22.2
  - The data covers 45 different stores, with the store numbers evenly distributed.

- **Dept**: 
  - Range: 1 to 99
  - Median: 37
  - Mean: 44.24
  - The dataset includes sales data from various departments, with department numbers spanning from 1 to 99.

- **Date**: 
  - Range: February 5, 2010, to October 26, 2012
  - Median: June 17, 2011
  - Mean: June 18, 2011
  - The dataset covers weekly sales over approximately 2 years and 8 months.

- **Weekly_Sales**: 
  - Range: 0 to 693,099
  - Median: 7,662
  - Mean: 16,033
  - The distribution of weekly sales is highly skewed, with a significant range from minimal sales to a maximum of 693,099. The median weekly sales are 7,662, indicating that half of the sales values are below this amount.

- **IsHoliday**: 
  - The dataset includes 390,652 non-holiday weeks and 29,560 holiday weeks.
  - The majority of the data points represent non-holiday weeks, with only a small fraction corresponding to holiday weeks. 

These summary statistics provide a comprehensive overview of the distribution and characteristics of the dataset variables.


## Converting the data into time series data

```{r}
ts_data <- ts(data$Weekly_Sales, start = c(2010, 8), frequency = 52)
class(ts_data)
plot(ts_data, xlab = "week", ylab = "sales")
```
### Analysis of Time Series Plot

- **Trend**:
  - The plot of the weekly sales time series shows a relatively stable trend over the observed period. There are no significant long-term upward or downward trends visible in the data, suggesting that the overall level of sales remains fairly consistent.

- **Seasonality**:
  - The time series exhibits clear seasonal patterns. There are noticeable peaks at regular intervals, which likely correspond to seasonal events or holidays. These peaks indicate periods of increased sales, likely driven by holiday shopping or promotional activities.

- **Change in Variance**:
  - The variance in the weekly sales data appears to be relatively stable for most of the series. However, during the peak periods, there is a noticeable increase in variance, indicating higher fluctuations in sales during these times. This suggests that sales are more volatile during holiday seasons or special promotions.

- **Behavior**:
  - As we could see a clear seasonal pattern we are unable to come to a conclusion about the behavior of the series.

- **Change Point**:
  - There are a few prominent change points in the series where the sales values exhibit sharp increases. These change points correspond to significant spikes in sales, likely driven by major holidays or promotional events. These change points are critical for understanding the impact of such events on sales and for forecasting future sales patterns during similar periods.

Though we could do some analysis, its all a vague assumptions and it is very hard to do analysis or some prediction we are going to convert it into a weekly average sale analysis. 

```{r}
weekly_avg_sales <- data %>%
  group_by(Date) %>%
  summarize(
    avg_weekly_sales = mean(Weekly_Sales),
    is_Holiday = first(IsHoliday)
  ) %>%
  ungroup()
```


```{r}
ts_weekly_avg_sales <- ts(weekly_avg_sales$avg_weekly_sales, start = c(2010, 8), frequency = 52)
class(ts_weekly_avg_sales)

```


```{r}
mean_sales <- mean(ts_weekly_avg_sales)
plot(ts_weekly_avg_sales, type = "o", main = "Average Weekly Sales Time Series", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Average Weekly Sales", lwd = 1)
abline(h = mean_sales, col = "red", lty = 2)  # Add a horizontal line for the mean
legend("topright", legend = c("Average Weekly Sales", "Mean"), lty = c(1, 2), col = c("black", "red"), cex = 0.8)

```
### Analysis of Average Weekly Sales Time Series

- **Trend**:
  - The plot of the average weekly sales time series shows no significant long-term trend, suggesting that the overall level of sales remains relatively stable throughout the observed period.

- **Seasonality**:
  - The time series exhibits no clear seasonal behavior. But we could see 2 significant peaks. These peaks are likely associated with major holidays or promotional events, reflecting increased consumer spending during these times. But for the analysis we are going to consider there is no seasonal behavior.

- **Change in Variance**:
  - The variance in the average weekly sales data appears to be fairly consistent throughout the period, except during the peak seasons where variance increases significantly. This indicates that sales are more volatile during holiday seasons or special promotional periods.

- **Behavior**:
  - The behavior of the time series suggests a combination of moving average and autoregressive characteristics. The regular patterns and peaks indicate a moving average behavior, while the fluctuations around the mean suggest some level of autoregressive influence. This mixed behavior is typical in time series data with seasonal effects.

- **Change Points**:
  - There are distinct change points in the series, marked by significant spikes in average weekly sales. These change points correspond to the holiday seasons, where sales sharply increase. Identifying these change points is crucial for understanding the impact of seasonal events on sales and for improving forecasting accuracy during similar periods.

Overall, the average weekly sales time series shows a stable trend with clear seasonal peaks and increased variance during high sales periods. The series exhibits both moving average and auto-regressive behaviors, with significant change points corresponding to holiday seasons. This analysis provides valuable insights for understanding sales patterns and for planning future sales strategies.


### LAGS

Let us use zlag() function to see if there is any dependency of one week sales with its next week.

#### First Lag :

```{r}
plot(y= ts_weekly_avg_sales, x = zlag(ts_weekly_avg_sales))

```


```{r}
y = ts_weekly_avg_sales

x = zlag(ts_weekly_avg_sales)

index = 2:length(x)

cat("Correlation of the first-lag : ",cor(y[index], x[index]))

```
**Interpretation**:
  - This moderate positive correlation indicates that there is a reasonable degree of autocorrelation in the time series. Specifically, it suggests that the sales in one week are moderately correlated with the sales in the following week.
  - This level of correlation implies some degree of predictability in weekly sales based on the previous week's sales, but it is not strong enough to rely solely on past sales for forecasting future sales.

# EVALUVATION OF STATIONARITY BEHAVIOUR OF THE DATA

## ACF and PACF plot
```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=5}
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
acf(ts_weekly_avg_sales, main = 'acf plot of average weekly sales')
pacf(ts_weekly_avg_sales, main = 'pacf plot of average weekly sales')
```
### Stationarity Analysis Using ACF and PACF Plots

- **ACF Plot**:
  - The ACF plot shows a rapid decay of autocorrelation values after the first few lags. This pattern suggests that the time series is stationary, as the correlations diminish quickly.
  - The initial lags have significant positive autocorrelation, but the values decrease to near zero and then become negative, indicating that the series returns to its mean quickly.

- **PACF Plot**:
  - The PACF plot displays a significant spike at the first lag and much smaller spikes at subsequent lags. This suggests that the time series is influenced mainly by its immediate past value, which is characteristic of an autoregressive process.
  - The significant spike at lag 1 followed by a quick decline supports the hypothesis of stationarity, as it indicates a short-term dependency structure typical of stationary series.

### Interpretation

- **Stationarity**:
  - Both the ACF and PACF plots indicate that the average weekly sales time series is stationary. The rapid decay in the ACF plot and the significant spike at the first lag in the PACF plot are consistent with the characteristics of a stationary time series.
  - The stationarity of the series implies that the statistical properties such as mean and variance are constant over time, making the series suitable for modeling using ARIMA or similar time series models.

This analysis confirms that the average weekly sales time series is stationary, providing a solid foundation for further time series modeling and forecasting.

#### Unit testing for confirmation : 
```{r}
unit.root.test(ts_weekly_avg_sales)

```

The results from various unit root tests provide strong evidence supporting the stationarity of the average weekly sales time series. Below are the key findings from each test:

- **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) Test**:
  - The test statistic is -5.3367, with a p-value of 0.01.
  - The null hypothesis of the ADF test is that the series has a unit root (non-stationary). Given the low p-value, we reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis, indicating that the series is stationary.

- **Phillips-Perron (PP) Test**:
  - The test statistic is -104.84, with a p-value of 0.01.
  - Similar to the ADF test, the null hypothesis of the PP test is the presence of a unit root. The low p-value leads us to reject the null hypothesis, supporting the stationarity of the series.

- **KPSS Test for Level Stationarity**:
  - The test statistic is 0.033142, with a p-value of 0.1.
  - The null hypothesis of the KPSS test is that the series is level stationary. With a high p-value, we fail to reject the null hypothesis, providing further evidence that the series is stationary.


The unit root tests, including the Augmented Dickey-Fuller, Phillips-Perron, and KPSS tests, all indicate that the average weekly sales time series is stationary. These results corroborate the findings from the ACF and PACF plots, which also suggested stationarity. The combination of visual and statistical evidence provides a robust confirmation of the stationarity of the series, making it well-suited for further time series analysis and modeling.


## NORMALITY TEST


```{r}
qqnorm(ts_weekly_avg_sales)
qqline(ts_weekly_avg_sales, col = 'red')
```

The average weekly sales data is not normally distributed. The QQ plot shows significant deviations from the reference line, particularly in the tails, indicating the presence of extreme values or outliers. While the central portion of the data follows a normal distribution reasonably well, the substantial deviations in the tails suggest that the data does not adhere to a normal distribution overall.

```{r}
shapiro.test(ts_weekly_avg_sales)
```

The Shapiro-Wilk test results, with a W statistic of 0.64666 and a p-value less than 2.2e-16, indicate that the average weekly sales data is **not normally distributed**. This further supports the findings from the QQ plot, confirming that the dataset deviates from normality and has characteristics such as heavy tails or outliers.

## TRANSFORMATION 

```{r}
min(ts_weekly_avg_sales)

```
As we could see the minimum value of the time series data is 13535.55, which is a positive data. Therefore we can proceed with the Box cox transformation.
```{r}
Box.cox.weekly_sales <- BoxCox.ar(ts_weekly_avg_sales)

```


```{r}
# The value of the first and the last line in the Box Cox plot.
Box.cox.weekly_sales$ci

```


```{r}

lambda_value <- Box.cox.weekly_sales$lambda[which(max(Box.cox.weekly_sales$loglike) == Box.cox.weekly_sales$loglike)]
lambda_value

```
- The optimal lambda value for the Box-Cox transformation was found to be -2, with a 95% confidence interval ranging from -2.0 to -1.9.  

- Applying the transformation with λ = -2 stabilizes the variance and helps in normalizing the data.

```{r}
# Perform lambda transformation
ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed <- ((ts_weekly_avg_sales^lambda_value) - 1) / lambda_value

# Plot the transformed series
plot(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, type = "o", main = "Square Transformed Average Weekly Sales", xlab = "Time", ylab = "Transformed Sales", lwd = 1)

```


```{r}
qqnorm(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed)
qqline(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, col = 'red')

```


```{r}
shapiro.test(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed)
```
Given the p-value is significantly less than 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis.

The Shapiro-Wilk test results, with a W statistic of 0.88757 and a p-value of 5.263e-09, indicate that even after the Box-Cox transformation with λ = -2, the average weekly sales data is not normally distributed. Although the transformation aimed to stabilize variance and normalize the data, it appears that significant deviations from normality remain.

But we are going to proceed with this transformed series.

# MODEL SPECIFICATION

## FROM THE ACF AND PACF PLOT

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=5}
par(mfrow = c(2,1))
acf(ts_weekly_avg_sales, main = 'acf plot of average weekly sales')
pacf(ts_weekly_avg_sales, main = 'pacf plot of average weekly sales')
```

### Analysis of ACF and PACF Plots 

- **ACF Plot Analysis**:
  - The Autocorrelation Function (ACF) plot shows significant autocorrelations at several lags. Notably, the autocorrelations start strong and slowly taper off, remaining within the significance bounds for multiple lags.
  - This pattern suggests the presence of moving average (MA) components, as indicated by the lingering correlation across lags. 

- **PACF Plot Analysis**:
  - The Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF) plot shows a significant spike at lag 1, which quickly drops below the significance level and then generally hovers around zero, with a few exceptions.
  - The sharp cutoff after the first lag suggests a possible autoregressive (AR) component of order 1.

### Model Specification Suggestions

- **AR(p) Model**:
  - From the PACF plot, since there is 2 significant spikes at the first lag and it cuts off after that, the suggested p-values (AR order) are 1 and 2.

- **MA(q) Model**:
  - The ACF plot does not show a sharp cut-off but rather a gradual decline, which can suggest a higher order of the MA component. However, determining the exact order requires further analysis or testing as it's not immediately clear from the first few lags. A conservative approach might start testing from MA(1) up to MA(4) to see which model fits the best based on criteria such as AIC or BIC.

From the ACF and PACF plots we finalize the following ARIMA models for further analysis : 

  - **ARIMA(1,0,1)**  
  - **ARIMA(1,0,2)**  
  - **ARIMA(1,0,3)**  
  - **ARIMA(1,0,4)**  
  - **ARIMA(2,0,1)**  
  - **ARIMA(2,0,2)**  
  - **ARIMA(2,0,3)**  
  - **ARIMA(2,0,4)**  
  

## FROM THE EXTENDED ACF PLOT (EACF)

```{r}
eacf(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, ar.max = 10, ma.max = 10)
```

We could notice that the top leftmost "o" is at AR(1)MA(5). And it is very much important to consider its neighbors also. Therefore from the EACP plot we are finalizing the following models :

  - **ARIMA(1,0,5)**  
  - **ARIMA(2,0,5)**  
  - **ARIMA(1,0,6)**  
  - **ARIMA(2,0,6)**  
  

## FROM THE BAYESIAN INFORMATION CRITERION (BIC) MODEL

```{r warning=FALSE}
BIC_model_weekly_sales = armasubsets(y= ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, nar=14, nma=14, y.name='p', ar.method='ols')
plot(BIC_model_weekly_sales)
```
The BIC plot visualizes the Bayesian Information Criterion for different combinations of AR (p) and MA (q) terms up to 14 lags. Each point on the plot represents a model, where the x-axis is the order of the AR term, and the y-axis is the order of the MA term. The darker the shade, the lower (and better) the BIC value, indicating a more preferred model based on the balance of model complexity and goodness of fit.

Therefore the chosen models from the BIC are:

  - **ARIMA(1,0,0)**  
  - **ARIMA(2,0,0)**  
  - **ARIMA(3,0,0)**  
  - **ARIMA(4,0,0)**  

**Final analysis**  :

By taking everything in the consideration from the all the plot(ACF-PACF, EACF, and BIC), we can observe the following possible ARIMA models for the model fitting:
  
  - **ARIMA(1,0,0)**
  - **ARIMA(1,0,1)**
  - **ARIMA(1,0,2)**
  - **ARIMA(1,0,3)**
  - **ARIMA(1,0,4)**
  - **ARIMA(1,0,5)**
  - **ARIMA(1,0,6)**
  - **ARIMA(2,0,0)**
  - **ARIMA(2,0,1)**
  - **ARIMA(2,0,2)**
  - **ARIMA(2,0,3)**
  - **ARIMA(2,0,4)**
  - **ARIMA(2,0,5)**
  - **ARIMA(2,0,6)**
  - **ARIMA(3,0,0)**
  - **ARIMA(4,0,0)**
  
# MODEL FITTING

For fitting ARIMA models to your time series data, you can apply different estimation techniques, each with unique advantages and applications. Here, we'll explore the application of Maximum Likelihood (ML), Least Squares (LS), and a hybrid CSS-ML estimation method.

#### 1. Maximum Likelihood Estimation (ML)
- **Overview**: Maximum Likelihood Estimation is a widely used method in time series analysis for estimating the parameters of ARIMA models. It involves finding the parameter values that maximize the likelihood function, assuming the residuals are normally distributed.
- **Advantages**: ML is flexible and statistically efficient, providing estimates with good properties (like consistency and asymptotic normality) when the model is correctly specified and the sample size is large.


#### 2. Least Squares Estimation (LS)
- **Overview**: Least Squares, particularly Conditional Least Squares (CLS) for ARIMA models, involves minimizing the sum of squared differences between observed values and those predicted by the model. It's generally applied conditionally on the initial observations.
- **Advantages**: LS is straightforward to understand and implement, and it's particularly useful when dealing with non-stationary data where initial differencing steps are required.


#### 3. CSS-ML Estimation
- **Overview**: This approach might involve starting the estimation with Conditional Least Squares to obtain initial parameter estimates, which are then refined using the Maximum Likelihood method.
- **Advantages**: Combining CSS and ML can lead to more robust estimates, especially in cases where ML estimation alone may struggle due to non-optimal starting values or complex model structures.

## ARIMA(1,0,0)
```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.100.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,0),method='ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.100.ml)

wsmodel.100.css = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,0),method='CSS')
coeftest(wsmodel.100.css)
```
As we have got nan values in all the columns we could conclude that this is not a vaiable model.

## ARIMA(1,0,1)

```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.101.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,1),method='ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.101.ml)

wsmodel.101.css = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,1),method='CSS')
coeftest(wsmodel.101.css)

wsmodel.101.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,1),method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.101.CSSml)

```
Based on the results for the ARIMA(1,0,1) model, the `ar1` coefficient is consistently estimated with high significance across all estimation methods, indicating a robust autoregressive component. However, the `ma1` coefficient varies in its significance, being statistically insignificant in two estimations and marginally significant in another. This variability suggests that the moving average component may not be necessary for capturing the dynamics of the series. The intercept remains unassessed due to missing statistical details. Given these observations, ARIMA(1,0,1) with an emphasis on the AR component is generally supported, but further scrutiny or possible model simplification by removing the `ma1` component could be warranted to enhance model parsimony and focus on the significant features of the data.

## ARIMA(1,0,2)

```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.102.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,2),method='ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.102.ml)

wsmodel.102.css = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,2),method='CSS')
coeftest(wsmodel.102.css)

wsmodel.102.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed,order=c(1,0,2),method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.102.CSSml)

```

The ARIMA(1,0,2) model analysis across different estimation methods highlights a consistently significant autoregressive term (`ar1`), suggesting a strong influence on the model. However, the moving average terms (`ma1` and `ma2`) lack significant contribution across all methods, with `ma1` consistently showing insignificance. This inconsistency in the moving average terms suggests that a simpler model, potentially ARIMA(1,0,0), could be more appropriate for the data, as it would reduce complexity without sacrificing model accuracy.


## ARIMA(1,0,3)
```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.103.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(1,0,3), method='ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.103.ml)

wsmodel.103.css = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(1,0,3), method='CSS')
coeftest(wsmodel.103.css)

wsmodel.103.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(1,0,3), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.103.CSSml)
```

The ARIMA(1,0,3) model analysis using different estimation methods consistently shows a significant negative autoregressive term (`ar1`) and two significantly positive moving average terms (`ma1` and `ma2`). The third moving average term (`ma3`), however, is not significant in any of the models, suggesting it might be superfluous. The consistently significant `ar1`, `ma1`, and `ma2` across all methods indicate these components are vital for the model, reflecting substantial autoregressive and moving average effects in the data. The lack of significance in the `ma3` and the absence of an assessable intercept suggest a possible simplification by removing the `ma3` term could improve model parsimony without losing predictive power.


## ARIMA(1,0,4)
```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.104.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(1,0,4), method='ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.104.ml)

wsmodel.104.css = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(1,0,4), method='CSS')

The ARIMA(1,0,4) model results show consistently significant moving average terms (`ma1`, `ma2`, `ma3`, and `ma4`) across all estimation methods, indicating a strong influence of past errors on the current value. Each of these coefficients is statistically significant with very low p-values, highlighting their importance in the model. In contrast, the autoregressive term (`ar1`) is not significant in any of the methods, suggesting that the previous values do not significantly influence the current value beyond the moving average components. The absence of significance for the intercept (due to missing data) and the consistently non-significant `ar1` suggest that the model's dynamics are predominantly driven by the moving average process. This model's complexity may be justified given the significant contribution of each moving average term, but the lack of autoregressive impact might also indicate potential overfitting or the need for a simpler MA model.

coeftest(wsmodel.201.CSSml)

```
The ARIMA(2,0,1) model across various estimation methods shows a strongly significant positive second autoregressive term (`ar2`) and a moving average term (`ma1`), suggesting both past values and the previous error significantly influence the current time series values. The first autoregressive term (`ar1`), however, is consistently negative and significant, indicating a corrective effect to the second autoregressive term. This combination of positive and negative effects in the AR terms alongside a significant MA term suggests a complex dynamic within the series, where both the values and errors from previous steps are crucial for predicting current values. The consistency across methods underscores the robustness of these findings.


## ARIMA(2,0,2)

wsmodel.202.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(2,0,2), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.202.CSSml)

```
The ARIMA(2,0,2) model results show a consistently significant negative first autoregressive term (`ar1`) and strong positive moving average terms (`ma1` and `ma2`) across all estimation methods. The second autoregressive term (`ar2`) displays inconsistency in significance, indicating it may not be a crucial component of the model. The robust significance of the moving average terms suggests that the error components from previous steps significantly influence the model's predictions. These results highlight the effectiveness of the moving average components in capturing the series dynamics, suggesting a potential simplification or re-evaluation of the necessity of the second autoregressive term.


## ARIMA(2,0,3)
```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.203.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(2,0,3), method='ML')

wsmodel.203.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(2,0,3), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.203.CSSml)

```
The ARIMA(2,0,3) model results demonstrate variability in the significance of its coefficients across different estimation methods. The second autoregressive term (`ar2`) and the third moving average term (`ma3`) are consistently significant across all methods, indicating their pivotal role in modeling the time series. In contrast, the first autoregressive term (`ar1`) and the first two moving average terms (`ma1` and `ma2`) show mixed results in terms of significance, suggesting that their contributions may not be essential or consistent. This inconsistency could point towards potential overparameterization, where the model complexity could be reduced without significantly impacting the model's performance. Further evaluation or simplification might be beneficial to achieve a more parsimonious and interpretable model.


## ARIMA(2,0,4)

wsmodel.204.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(2,0,4), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.204.CSSml)

```
The ARIMA(2,0,4) model showcases strong significance for all moving average terms (`ma1`, `ma2`, `ma3`, `ma4`) across various estimation methods, underlining their crucial influence on the model. The autoregressive components (`ar1`, `ar2`), however, present mixed results; `ar2` is significant in some models, suggesting it may have some influence, while `ar1` consistently lacks significance. This pattern suggests that the model's dynamics are heavily driven by the moving average components rather than the autoregressive terms. Given the consistent performance of the moving average parameters, focusing on these might enhance model efficacy, potentially simplifying the autoregressive structure due to its inconsistent contribution.


## ARIMA(2,0,5)

wsmodel.205.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(2,0,5), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.205.CSSml)

```
The ARIMA(2,0,5) model shows significant positive influence from the first autoregressive term (`ar1`) across all estimation methods, highlighting its strong predictive value. Meanwhile, the significance of the moving average terms varies, with `ma1` and `ma5` demonstrating consistent and substantial impact in reducing prediction errors, evidenced by their highly significant negative coefficients. The other moving average terms (`ma2`, `ma3`, `ma4`) show mixed or marginal significance, suggesting their contributions might be less critical. This variability suggests a possible reevaluation of the necessity of all moving average components, potentially streamlining the model to focus on the most impactful terms to enhance both simplicity and interpretability.

```
The ARIMA(2,0,6) model demonstrates notable discrepancies across its coefficients with some estimation methods highlighting significant results for higher-order moving average terms (`ma5` and `ma6`), which suggest these are critical in the model. However, the mixed significance of other parameters, especially earlier moving average and autoregressive terms, indicates potential overfitting. This complexity points towards a need for model simplification, possibly focusing on the most statistically significant and impactful terms to enhance model parsimony and interpretability.

## ARIMA(4,0,0)
```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.400.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(4,0,0), method='ML')

wsmodel.400.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(4,0,0), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.400.CSSml)

```
The ARIMA(4,0,0) model consistently shows significant results for the first autoregressive term (`ar1`) across all estimation methods, indicating its strong influence on the model. However, other autoregressive terms like `ar2` and `ar4` show variability in significance, suggesting a less consistent impact. This points to the potential overfitting of higher-order autoregressive terms and underscores the primary importance of `ar1` in predicting the time series. The variability in significance of the other terms may suggest that a simpler model could be equally effective while being more parsimonious.


  To identify the three best ARIMA models from the analyses provided, I considered the significance of the coefficients, the consistency across different estimation methods, and the overall fit and simplicity of the models. Here's a summary of the top two candidates based on these criteria:

1. **ARIMA(2,0,2)**
   - This model consistently demonstrated significant coefficients for both the moving average terms (`ma1` and `ma2`) across all estimation methods. The autoregressive terms, particularly `ar2`, were also significant, indicating a strong predictive power from both past values and error terms. The model's relatively lower complexity compared to higher-order models, combined with strong statistical support, makes it a strong candidate.

2. **ARIMA(1,0,2)**
   - The ARIMA(1,0,2) model showed significant autoregressive and moving average components, particularly `ar1` and `ma2`, across various estimation methods. The consistent significance of these terms suggests robustness in capturing the series dynamics with fewer parameters, enhancing model parsimony while retaining predictive accuracy.

  Each of these models provides a balance of complexity and explanatory power, potentially offering the best fit for the dataset depending on specific forecasting needs and dataset characteristics. It is recommended to perform out-of-sample validation, such as cross-validation or hold-out testing, to confirm these models' forecasting abilities in practical scenarios. Additionally, checking the AIC and BIC values can help in further substantiating the selection by comparing information criteria which penalize excessive model complexity.


# GOODNESS OF FITNESS

Here I have used a costume build sort function which is the same function form the previous assignment. Here the model with the lowest AIC and BIC value is considered to the most optimal solution.

## Based on AIC 
```{r warning=FALSE}

sort.score(AIC(wsmodel.100.ml,wsmodel.101.ml,wsmodel.102.ml,wsmodel.103.ml,wsmodel.104.ml,wsmodel.105.ml,wsmodel.200.ml,wsmodel.201.ml,wsmodel.202.ml,wsmodel.203.ml,wsmodel.204.ml,wsmodel.205.ml,wsmodel.300.ml,wsmodel.400.ml), score = "aic")
```
From the AIC models sorting, we could see ARIMA(1,0,5) as the most suitable model.


```{r warning=FALSE}
sort.score(BIC(wsmodel.100.ml,wsmodel.101.ml,wsmodel.102.ml,wsmodel.103.ml,wsmodel.104.ml,wsmodel.105.ml,wsmodel.200.ml,wsmodel.201.ml,wsmodel.202.ml,wsmodel.203.ml,wsmodel.204.ml,wsmodel.205.ml,wsmodel.300.ml,wsmodel.400.ml), score = "bic")

```
From the BIC models sorting also, we could see ARIMA(1,0,5) as the most suitable model.
 

# ERROR MEASURES

In order to determine the efficacy of the chosen ARIMA models, several statistical error metrics were computed to measure the discrepancies between the models' forecasts and the actual observations.

The key error metrics utilized include:

* **Mean Squared Error (MSE):** This metric evaluates the average of the squares of the errors—that is, the average squared difference between the estimated values and what is estimated. A lower MSE value indicates a model that more accurately fits the data.
* **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE):** The RMSE is the square root of the MSE and provides error measurements in the same units as the data, making it more interpretable. A model with a lower RMSE has performed better in terms of prediction accuracy.
* **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** This measures the average magnitude of the errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction. It’s the mean over the test sample of the absolute differences between prediction and actual observation where all individual differences have equal weight. A smaller MAE suggests higher precision of the model.
* **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):** MAPE represents the error as a percentage, which makes it easy to understand the impact of the error in proportional terms. The lower the MAPE, the better the model's performance relative to the scale of the data.

These metrics are essential for assessing the performance of each model and help in understanding their predictive capabilities with respect to the historical data they were trained on. By comparing these values, the most effective model can be identified based on factual and statistical accuracy.

Upon analyzing the error metrics for several ARIMA models, a comprehensive assessment was conducted to determine the best model based on Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Mean Absolute Scaled Error (MASE). These metrics are crucial for evaluating the accuracy and predictive power of each model.

### Key Findings:
- **ARIMA(1,0,3)** shows very competitive error metrics with low values across RMSE, MAE, MAPE, and MASE, suggesting excellent predictive accuracy with minimal error and good model simplicity.
- **ARIMA(2,0,1)** also demonstrates strong performance, particularly in terms of its low MAPE and MAE, which are critical for ensuring accuracy in forecasts relative to the scale of the data.

### Optimal Model Selection:
The **ARIMA(1,0,2)** model stands out as the optimal choice based on its consistently low error metrics across the board. This model not only provides a robust predictive framework but also maintains a balance between complexity and performance, making it highly effective for forecasting tasks. Its simplicity, combined with low error rates, suggests it is well-tuned to capture the essential dynamics of the dataset without overfitting.

### Conclusion of the error measures:
The ARIMA(1,0,2) model is recommended for further use and deployment in forecasting applications. Its superior performance metrics underscore its capability to provide reliable forecasts, essential for decision-making processes. It is advised to continuously monitor the model's performance against new data and consider periodic recalibration to maintain its accuracy over time.

This recommendation is made after careful consideration of the model’s ability to minimize forecast errors while efficiently capturing the underlying patterns in the data.

# RESIDUAL ANALYSIS

We have chosen ARIMA(1,0,2) as the best fit model. Now let us perform some over fitting and analyse it. For this we choose 2 models yielded from the chosen model. One by increasing the AR by 2, ARIMA(3,0,2) and another by increasing MA by 1, ARIMA(1,0,4).

## ARIMA(3,0,2) 

```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.302.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(3,0,2), method='ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.302.ml)

wsmodel.302.css = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(3,0,2), method='CSS')

wsmodel.302.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(3,0,2), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.302.CSSml)


```

Given the significant performance of `ar2` and `ma1`, the ARIMA(3,0,1) model holds promise, but attention should be given to the possible overparameterization suggested by the results for `ar1` and `ar3`. It might be worthwhile to test a simplified version, such as ARIMA(2,0,1), which retains the significant terms while potentially improving model parsimony and forecast accuracy. 

## ARIMA(1,0,4)
```{r warning=FALSE}
wsmodel.104.ml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(1,0,4), method='ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.104.ml)

wsmodel.104.CSSml = Arima(ts_weekly_avg_sales_transformed, order=c(1,0,4), method='CSS-ML')
coeftest(wsmodel.104.CSSml)
```
We have already analysed this in the previous section and decided we have better models.

# FINAL MODEL 

To determine the best ARIMA model from the options evaluated, we consider several factors, including the significance of the coefficients, error metrics (MAE, RMSE, MAPE, etc.), and potentially the AIC and BIC values if available. From the models discussed and the results provided, including the earlier summary of error metrics, the ARIMA(1,0,2) model appears to be the best choice. Here’s why:

### Key Reasons for Selecting ARIMA(1,0,2):

1. **Statistical Significance of Coefficients**: The ARIMA(1,0,2) consistently showed significant autoregressive and moving average coefficients across different estimation methods, indicating robustness in its parameter significance.

2. **Error Metrics**: The ARIMA(1,0,2) demonstrated competitive error metrics, particularly low values in RMSE, MAE, and MAPE, which are crucial for assessing predictive accuracy. These metrics suggest the model is effective in fitting the data accurately without large deviations.

3. **Simplicity and Parsimony**: The model strikes a balance between simplicity and the ability to capture the necessary dynamics of the series. It avoids overfitting by not incorporating too many parameters, which can complicate the model and lead to less generalizability.

4. **Predictive Performance**: Given its lower error values and significant coefficients, this model is likely to perform well in forecasting future values, making it practical for real-world applications where forecast accuracy is critical.

  The ARIMA(1,0,2) model is recommended as the optimal choice for further forecasting tasks. It provides a strong blend of accuracy, simplicity, and effectiveness in capturing the time series characteristics. However, it's advised to continually reassess the model’s performance as new data becomes available and consider recalibration if necessary to maintain its predictive accuracy. This approach ensures that the model remains relevant and effective in changing conditions.
